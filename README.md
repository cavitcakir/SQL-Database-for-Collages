	The project is about creating a database that is going to store course information, information of students that take course and information of instructor of courses.
	
	The course table contains location of the course, time, pre-requisites of the course, which course/courses it is the prerequisite of, which faculty the course belongs to and instructor.
	
	The student table contains the id of the student, name, surname, e-mail, department, sex, which courses that student takes and year.

	The instructor table contains name, surname, e-mail, courses given by the instructor, department.

	Also, we are going to store which courses are located in which faculties.
